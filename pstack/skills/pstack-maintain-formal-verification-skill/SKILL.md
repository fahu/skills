description: "pstack: Bring a project's formal verification back in line with the code after the code changes: find the commits that touched verified code, update the model, harness, or properties to describe the code as it is now, rerun, and say whether each failure is drift in the verification or a bug in the code. Use for $pstack-maintain-formal-verification-skill, \"is the model still true to the code\", or after merges and refactors that touched verified code without rechecking it."

# pstack · maintain-formal-verification-skill

This is a Codex adaptation of Lauren Tan’s **pstack**, pinned in
[upstream.lock.json](../../upstream.lock.json).

1. Read [the Codex adapter](../../codex.md) before following upstream material.
   It replaces incompatible tool, model, autonomy, and path instructions.
   Applicable project instructions and the user’s request take precedence.
2. Read [the upstream workflow](../../upstream/skills/maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md)
   and apply it through that adapter. Load supporting files only as needed.
3. Route cross-skill calls through the prefixed entrypoints in `../`.
   Resolve other relative references beside the original upstream file.
   Report missing required capabilities; do not claim skipped checks passed.
